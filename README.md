# Tornado-app
The application visualizes 62,000 tornadoes for the entire U.S. from 1950 to 2016, with about 2,500 tornadoes in Illinois alone. Several features allow users to navigate tornado size and loss data

# Credits
The original application was made by myself, Pedro Borges, Megan Hauck,  and Namaswi Chandarana for UIC's Spring 2018 CS 424, Visualization and Visual Analytics, and Professor Andy Johnson.

Run time may be slow, as the app was meant to be run on the Visualization Lab server
